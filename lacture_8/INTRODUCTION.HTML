<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its
content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bullete
points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, thisarticle will give you a
basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>

  <B><U><H4>The main parts of our element are as follows:</H4></B></U><BR>

<B>1)The opening tag:</B>This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in
openingand closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect
— in this case where the paragraph begins.<BR><BR>
<B>2)The closing tag:</B>This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward
slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the 
paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can
lead to strange results.<BR><BR>
<B>3)The content:</B>This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.<BR><BR>
<B>4)The element:</B>The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
